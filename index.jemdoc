== About Me
I am broadly interested in AI for decision-making and envision a future where AI agents coexist with humans to enable complex task automation and decision support. My research themes include:
- Ensuring the safe and reliable deployment of AI agents in real-world applications, with continuous alignment and adaptation to business and societal objectives.
- Reducing the operational costs of AI systems to enable scalable, low-latency deployment across diverse environments.
- Leveraging AI to simulate human and system behavior (known as "digital twin"), enabling cost-effective, scalable experimentation and testing.
- Optimizing large-scale decision-making systems through AI and reinforcement learning.

I am a founding member of [https://americanbazaaronline.com/2024/12/19/cimulate-ai-raises-28-million-in-series-a-funding-to-enhance-customer-experience-457838/ Cimulate.AI], developing Customer-GPT for e-commerce. We are hiring!  

I've collaborated with organizations like Anheuser-Busch InBev, TikTok, and Liberty Mutual. My work with Anheuser-Busch InBev on developing an innovative experimentation platform earned the Daniel H. Wagner Prize in 2022 ([https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tianyi-peng-8a6909b4_2022-daniel-h-wagner-prize-awarded-to-researchers-activity-6990466260127907841-FvoR/?originalSubdomain=dz INFORMS news]). My research has also received the APS Best Student Paper Prize and RMP Jeff McGill Student Paper Award.

I hold a Ph.D. from MIT and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Tsinghua University ([https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/ Yao Class]).

#I am broadly interested in developing machine learning and causal inference algorithms for large-scale dynamic decision-making systems in the real world. 
#In particular, I focus on developing next-generationÂ *Experimentation Platforms*, which provide scalable, low-cost solutions for discovering beneficial strategies/policies.
