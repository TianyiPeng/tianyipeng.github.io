== About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at MIT, advised by [http://web.mit.edu/vivekf/www/ Prof. Vivek Farias] ([http://orc.mit.edu/ MIT ORC]) and also mentored by [https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aali1/index.html Prof. Andrew Li] at CMU. 
I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Tsinghua University ([https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/ Yao Class]). 

I am broadly interested in developing machine learning and causal inference algorithms for large-scale dynamic decision-making systems in the real world. 
In particular, I focus on developing next-generation *Experimentation Platforms*, which provide scalable, low-cost solutions for discovering beneficial strategies/policies. I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with [https://www.anheuser-busch.com/ Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI)], [https://www.takeda.com/ Takeda],[https://www.tiktok.com/ Tiktok], [https://www.libertymutual.com/ Liberty Mutual], 
and the [https://www.broadinstitute.org/ Broad Institute]. My work has been recognized with a NeurIPS oral presentation, as well as being selected as finalist for the APS Student Paper Competition and Wagner Prize.

I am on the job market this year, 2022-2023.

#I am a Ph.D. student at MIT, where I am fortunate to be advised by [http://web.mit.edu/vivekf/www/ Prof. Vivek Farias] at MIT Operations Research Center ([http://orc.mit.edu/ MIT ORC]) and also mentored by 
#[https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/li-andrew.html Prof. Andrew Li] at CMU. 

#I received a Bachelor's degree in computer science from [https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/ Yao Class] (exceptional pilot CS program led by Prof. Andrew C. Yao) in 2017.

#I am in the job market 2022-2023.

#== Research Interests

#I am broadly interested in developing machine learning algorithms for large-scale dynamic decision-making systems in the real world. 

#My current research directions are *Machine Learning and Causal Inference*, an emerging field that marries different areas such as operations research, statistics, computer science, and econometrics.

#In particular, I focus on developing the next-generation *Experimentation Platform*, which aims to provide scalable and low-cost solutions for identifying beneficial strategies/policies that otherwise are impossible to be discovered. 
#Such a platform uses statistics, machine learning, and reinforcement learning together with robust validations to overcome real-world causal inference challenges.

#- the environment is highly noisy and non-stationary
#- the groups have complicated interactions and interference    
#- the results suffer from the adherence and compliance issues

#Along this line, I collaborated with [https://www.anheuser-busch.com/ Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI)], the world's largest beer producer, to develope their physical retailer experimentation platform. 
#I am also working with [https://www.takeda.com/ Takeda], a giant pharmaceutical company, to tackle the late and mis-diagnosis issues of patients through causal inference. 

#My other industry partners include [https://www.tiktok.com/ Tiktok], Liberty Mutual, and Broad Institute, where I am developing practical machine learning solutions through a causal lens. 

#Some of the work have been selected as finalists in *APS Student Paper Competition* and *Wagner Prize*. 

#My current research directions are *Machine Learning and Causal Inference*: an emerging field that aims to integrate causal inference into machine learning algorithms to improve the robustness, interpretability, and trustworthiness of AI, 
#which marries different areas such as econometrics, computer science, and operations research. 

#I love to collaborate with industry partners and have been working on empirical applications ranging from operations management, bioinformatics, to recommendation systems.  

#My current research directions are in high dimensional statistics, machine learning, focusing on causal inference, low-rank matrix estimation, and applications on operations research.
