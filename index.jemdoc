== About Me
My current research directions are in the high dimensional statistics, machine learning, with a focus in the field of causal inference, low-rank matrix estimation, and applications on operations research.

I am luckily advised by [http://web.mit.edu/vivekf/www/ Prof. Vivek Farias] at MIT Operations Research Center ([http://orc.mit.edu/ MIT ORC]) and also mentored by 
[https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/li-andrew.html Prof. Andrew Li] at CMU.
